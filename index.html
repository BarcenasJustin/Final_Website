    <p> Weapons play a very important role in Tanki Online. The type of gun you choose will strongly affect your style of playing, whether it is aggressive lightning-fast attacks or firing from protected positions.</p>
    <p> In addition, the weapon you like can be upgraded. All guns have four modifications, from the weakest to the strongest (from M0 to M3). Accordingly, the price of the junior modification isn't high. You can already try the most popular tactics at junior ranks without having to spend a large amount of crystals. But it's impossible to get everything you want at once. Particular guns and modifications can be purchased only with a certain rank.</p>
    <p> It’s important to know that some guns in the game have a maximum range. On distances greater than this range, these guns may do no damage at all. If the distance is greater than the max damage range, the maximum and minimum damage statistics congruently decrease until the minimum damage range is reached, at which damage values become identical to the weak damage. For example, If it says that “up to 50m – 100%, after 100m – 20%”, then the gun’s damage stats will decrease from 100% to 20% between 50 to 100 meters. </p>

    <h3> Firebird </h3>
	  <img src="Firebird.png" alt="Firebird" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
      <p> A good weapon for short-range battle. Fires a stream of napalm that burns tanks within its damage radius. Burning opponents continue to take damage even after the Firebird's attack stops. Can thaw frozen tanks and is a great choice for fast and medium hulls. </p>
    <h3> Freeze </h3>
	  <img src="Freeze.png" alt="Freeze" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
      <p> A unique weapon for short-range battles. Slows opponents by freezing them and can put out fires caused by Firebird. In the right hands, it can destroy an enemy without receiving any damage in return. Great for fast and medium hulls. </p>
    <h3> Isida </h3>
	  <img src="Isida.png" alt="Isida" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
      <p> An essential gun in team battles. Can repair tanks within its firing radius and effectively destroy opponents at short-range. Energy stores an last for five seconds when attacking an opponent, but lasts for ten seconds when healing an ally. Works well with any hull. </p>
    <h3> Hammer </h3>
	  <img src="Hammer.png" alt="Hammer" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
      <p> Perfect choice for close range combat. Three powerful shots mean your opponents have no way out. Its shotgun functionality allows Hammer to hit several targets with one shot at medium ranges. Works best with medium hulls.</p>
    <h3> Twins </h3>
	  <img src="Twins.png" alt="Twins" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
      <p> A gun with unlimited firing duration. Effective at short to mid range. Its high rate of fire makes it ideal for supressing enemies. Works well with any hull. </p>
    <h3> Ricochet </h3>
	  <img src="Ricochet.png" alt="Ricochet" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
      <p> A gun that can be tough to control. Ideal for short to mid-range battles. Possesses a unique feature in that its shells ricochet off walls, allowing it to shoot around corners. Just make sure you don’t take a ricocheting round right in the kisser! Goes well with all hulls. </p>
    <h3> Smoky </h3>
	  <img src="Smoky.png" alt="Smoky" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
      <p> A gun for mid to long-range battles. Fires single shells and can land critical hits. Works well with all hulls. </p>
    <h3> Striker </h3>
	  <img src="Striker.png" alt="Striker" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
      <p> An anti-tank missile launcher best suited for mid to long range combat. This turret is equipped with a laser aiming system for firing homing missiles. Missiles will damage any enemy within the blast radius, including the tank firing them if it is standing too close. This turret can be mounted on any hull, but a heavier hull is recommended for easier aiming. </p>
    <h3> Vulcan </h3>
	  <img src="Vulcan.png" alt="Vulcan" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
      <p> A turret with an immense firing rate. It is best suited for combat at mid and long ranges. Vulcan has a unique gyroscope feature, which makes knocking off its aim very challenging, even when it's under heavy enemy fire. Caution — When using Vulcan, firing continuously for an extended time may overheat and damage your tank! Ideal for use with heavy hulls. </p>
    <h3> Thunder </h3>
	  <img src="Thunder.png" alt="Thunder" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
      <p> A great choice for mid-range battles. Rounds from Thunder explode on impact and damage everything within their blast radius. This makes it risky to use at short-range as it may inflict self-damage. Goes well with any hull. </p>
    <h3> Railgun </h3>
	  <img src="Railgun.png" alt="Railgun" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
      <p> A gun for professionals. Performs well at any range. Takes a long time to reload and needs to warm up before firing, but packs a hefty punch. A good pairing for any hull, but light tanks run the risk of flipping over from the recoil! A favorite amongst clan players. </p>
    <h3> Magnum </h3>
	  <img src="Magnum.png" alt="Magnum" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
      <p> A turret with the greatest recoil, the longest barrel and the biggest explosion. It requires an extensive amount of practice in order to master targeting with this turret. Pairs well with heavy and medium hulls, since light hulls are too weak and either inflict an overwhelming amount of self-damage, or they simply won't survive for long. Although there are certain exceptions, such as camping with a camouflage paint, light hulls also risk flipping over from the immense recoil and impact force. </p>
    <h3> Shaft </h3>
	  <img src="Shaft.png" alt="Shaft" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
      <p> A great choice for a sniper. It is the only gun with an optical scope attached, allowing it to easily hit targets at long range. Can also fire short-range without using the scope. Works well with any hull, but light hulls risk flipping over from the recoil! </p>
